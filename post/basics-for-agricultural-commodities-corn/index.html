<li>This is my <strong>personal study notes</strong> for agricultural commodities.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="production">Production</h2>
<ul>
<li>Corn started as a primary food source for humans, but today it’s mainly used as animal feed.</li>
<li>Worldwide production of corn is dominated by the United States.
<ul>
<li>Then followed by China</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Corn production depends on two things—acreage harvested and yield per acre.</li>
<li>Some planted acreage may not be harvested due to poor performance of the crop, pest infestation, or <strong>extreme weather events</strong> that would destroy the crop.
<ul>
<li>On average in the United States since 1980, 10 percent of the acreage planted for corn was not harvested.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The yield per acre keeps rising as a result of technological advances in farm machinery, fertilizer, and genetically modified seed, among other things.
<ul>
<li>The volatility in yield occurs because the crop is vulnerable to stress during the tasseling and pollination stages.
<ul>
<li>In the United States, these two stages occur between the middle of July through August.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The two common stressors for agricultural plants are <strong>drought and heat</strong>.
<ul>
<li><strong>Excess moisture</strong> during the harvest can result in puddles in the fields, and as a result machinery can’t get into the fields to harvest the crop.
<ul>
<li>This causes the mature crop to sit in the field longer, exposing it to mold and mildew along with changing weather towards the winter season.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the United States, the corn marketing year starts in September and ends in August.
<ul>
<li>This is because the new corn crop would begin to be marketed starting in September as harvest begins.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="consumption">Consumption</h2>
<ul>
<li>Worldwide corn consumption is highest in the United States and is followed by China, the European Union, Brazil, and Mexico.</li>
<li>Demand for corn is dominated by its use in <strong>livestock feed</strong> for animals such as cattle, hogs, and poultry.
<ul>
<li>In some countries, corn is a <strong>staple</strong> for human consumption.</li>
<li>Corn is also utilized in starch form in consumer and <strong>industrial</strong> products.</li>
<li>Corn has been grabbing headlines since 2005 for its use as a fuel in the form of <strong>ethanol</strong>.
<ul>
<li>Current research is focused on producing ethanol from cellulose-based products such as farm waste, wood chips, and switch grass.</li>
<li>As a percentage of total demand ethanol now consumes more corn than that used in the food and industrial sectors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The corn market does compete with other grains for use in the <strong>feed</strong> sector.
<ul>
<li>Other feed grains available to livestock producers are sorghum, barley, and oats.</li>
<li>Corn also competes with sugar for its use in the <strong>sweetener</strong> market, especially in soft drinks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="storage-and-cost-of-carry">Storage and Cost of Carry</h3>
<ul>
<li>Grains are largely stored in grain elevators located near major rivers and ports for shipping.
<ul>
<li>In the United States, the Mississippi River and its tributaries are commonly used for grain shipments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the grain market, the supply comes all at harvest whereas demand is spread throughout the year.
<ul>
<li>This creates supply in excess of immediate consumption.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cost of storage
<ul>
<li>cost = (cost of near future ∗ (Interest/360) + daily storage cost) * days in storage</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Full carry</strong> is when the price difference between two different future months equals the full cost of carrying the commodity from the delivery month of the first contract to the next.
<ul>
<li>One reason the market is less than 100 percent full carry is that it is extremely difficult to go short the physical corn.</li>
<li>In addition, even if the arbitrager were able to short the physical corn, he would not receive the storage costs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the corn market, when the futures contracts are pricing in some percentage of full carry, as in the previous example, it is called a <strong>normal futures curve</strong>.
<ul>
<li>It is normal because this is how the futures curve is shaped most of the time in the grain markets.</li>
<li>This is also called <strong>contango</strong>, when the far future price is higher than the near future price.</li>
<li>An inverted curve shows a negative percent of full carry, suggesting that consumers are unwilling to pay the farmer part of the cost to store the corn for future consumption.
<ul>
<li>An inverted curve in the grain markets implies there may be a short-term shortage in the market and consumers would rather have the grain now than later.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="corn-futures">Corn Futures</h2>
<ul>
<li>Different corn futures trade in many different countries. The most liquid corn future trades on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT).
<ul>
<li>The CBOT corn future has a contract size of 5,000 bushels.</li>
<li>It trades in cents/bushel and has a minimum tick size of 0.25 cents/bushel.
<ul>
<li>This tick size is equal to a value of $12.50.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>That means if you own one futures contract at a price of 400.00 cents/bushel and you sell it at 400.25 cents/bushel, you have made $12.50, minus transaction costs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The CBOT corn future contract trades futures months of <strong>December, March, May, and July</strong> for each marketing year.</li>
<li>For smaller investors the CBOT has an <strong>E-mini corn futures contract</strong>.
<ul>
<li>This contract is one-fifth of the size of the regular CBOT corn futures contract.
<ul>
<li>Each E-mini corn future has a contract size of 1,000 bushel, a tick size of 0.125 cents/bushel, and a tick value of $1.25.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The E-mini corn future can be physically delivered. The delivery specifications are the same as those on the full-size corn future.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Both the Tokyo Grain Exchange and the Dalian Commodity Exchange in China also trade fairly liquid corn future contracts.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="price-history">Price History</h3>
<ul>
<li>Overall the price of corn stayed between 200 cents/bushel and 300 cents/bushel for most of this time period.
<ul>
<li>Why do the price spikes last for only a short time?
<ul>
<li>The answer is <strong>economics</strong>. Demand and Supply matter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>While this concept does hold to a small degree, there is also the issue of government <strong>subsidies</strong> to farmers.
<ul>
<li>The extra money that farmers receive from subsidies allows them to continue to plant corn each year regardless of how low the price is.</li>
<li>Government subsidies for corn come mainly in three forms
<ul>
<li>direct payments,</li>
<li>counter-cyclical payments, and</li>
<li>subsidized insurance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Still, price spikes for corn do occur, and they are usually a result of poor crop yields due to <strong>weather</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>USDA</strong> publishes a variety of weekly, monthly, and yearly reports that are helpful in determining the fundamental picture of the corn market.
<ul>
<li>The USDA makes estimates for many categories including domestic demand, acreage harvested, crop yield, production, exports, and ending stock totals.</li>
<li>Possibly the most important publication from the USDA is the monthly <em>World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates</em> (WASDE).</li>
<li>Another USDA publication that is important for the corn market is the yearly Prospective Planting report published at the end of March.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
