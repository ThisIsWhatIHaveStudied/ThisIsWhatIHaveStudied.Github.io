                <p>Last night, I watched the video announcement for Noble Prize in Economics. Not only were Claudia Golding’s contributions in revealing the root causes of gender inequality in careers remarkable, but the presentation introducing her achievements by Swedish scholar Randi Hjalmarsson was also impressive.  Check it out here from 4:40: https://youtu.be/8ZJ_lQMltTs.</p>

<p>Baraniuk, Chris. “A Simple Solution for Keeping Microplastics out of the Water Supply.” <em>Atlantic Monthly (Boston, Mass.: 1993)</em>, Oct. 2023, https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/10/microplastic-pollution-biodegradable-sponges/675572/.</p>

<p>Sponges. Is there anything they can’t do? <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1439-0485.2008.00235.x">For millennia</a>, humans have used dried natural sponges to clean up, to paint, and as vessels for drinking; we’ve even used them <a href="https://collection.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/objects/co96213/contraceptive-sponge-contraceptive-sponge">as contraceptive devices</a>. Whether synthetic or natural, sponges are great at ensnaring tiny particles in their many pores. And as scientists around the world are beginning to show, sponges’ cavity-filled forms could provide a solution to one of our era’s biggest scourges: microplastic pollution.</p>

<p>They tried it with liquids as varied as tap water, seawater, and—why not—soup from a local takeout spot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The plastic-gobbling sponges are biodegradable and made mostly from starch and gelatin. Looking a bit like large white marshmallows, they are so light that balancing one atop a flower leaves the plant’s petals upright and unyielding, which the researchers suggest ought to make them cheap and easy to transport. Inside, the sponges’ structure appears less like lots of tiny bubble-like cavities and more like a jagged surface.</p>
