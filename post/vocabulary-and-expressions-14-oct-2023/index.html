                <p>I have been contemplating the use of ChatGPT to analyse the articles for my digestion. After a few attempts, however, I found it far from being helpful given that the AI failed to identify crucial grammar points or expressions for me to grasp. As a result, I reverted to manually collecting this information on my own. A brand new week is approaching, and I'm optimistic that we will all make progress in the forthcoming bright days.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHow to Deal with the Global Anti-Climate Backlash.‚Äù <em>Economist (London, England: 1843)</em>, The Economist, 12 Oct. 2023, https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/10/12/how-to-deal-with-the-global-anti-climate-backlash.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>The shift to electric cars is ‚Äúa transition to hell‚Äù that will destroy ‚Äúyour beautiful way of life‚Äù, says Donald Trump. He is far from the only politician to oppose greenery.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>He is <mark>far from</mark> the only politician ...
<ul>
<li>If you say that something is far from a particular thing or far from being the case, you are emphasising that it is not that particular thing or not at all the case, especially when people expect or assume that it is.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>On October 8th voters in two big German states walloped the parties of the green-tinged ruling coalition.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Wallop: strike or hit very hard.
<ul>
<li>&quot;they walloped the back of his head with a stick&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>It has many causes. Some voters deny that climate change is happening. Others accept that it is, but do not want to pay higher taxes or energy prices to tackle it. Many object to the hassle of installing new equipment. Some, especially the old, resist any kind of change. Others ask why they should make sacrifices when other countries, especially ones they dislike, are doing less.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>To <mark>tackle</mark> climate change
<ul>
<li>Tackle**üòó* to set about dealing with
<ul>
<li><em>tackle</em> the problem</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Object to: to oppose something firmly and usually with words or arguments</li>
<li>Make sacrifices</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Under this cauldron of grievances, populist politicians have heaped lighted coals. Many exaggerate the costs of going green, embellish the details (Britain‚Äôs opposition had no plans for a meat tax, whatever Mr Sunak says) and seek to turn climate into a culture-war battleground: the metropolitan elite will grab your car and make you eat tofu! Such tactics have proved potent.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Cauldron: A large pot or kettle, often used metaphorically here to describe a situation filled with intense emotions or issues.
<ul>
<li><mark>Under</mark> this cauldron of ...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Grievance: Complaints or resentments about real or perceived injustices.
<ul>
<li>Resentment: a feeling of indignant displeasure or persistent ill will at something regarded as a wrong, insult, or injury</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><mark>Heap lighted coals</mark>: This phrase suggests that populist politicians have added fuel to the fire or intensified existing grievances, possibly for their political benefit.</li>
<li>Such tactics have proved potent: This sentence indicates that these strategies have been effective and successful in achieving their goals.
<ul>
<li>Potent: chemically or medicinally effective</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Such polarisation means bigger flip-flops when power changes hands.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Bigger flip-flops: in this context suggests that the policy changes or shifts in direction are more substantial or noticeable. A &quot;flip-flop&quot; in politics refers to a change in a politician's stance or position on an issue.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Even voters who do not care about greenery like jobs and fear China, goes the calculation, and a future Republican president would shrink from scrapping subsidies that are popular with recipients in red and blue states alike. All true, but this approach has big drawbacks.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Goes the calculation</li>
<li>All true</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>First, framing green energy as a matter of industrial policy and national security opens the door to protectionism, which raises the cost of green technology by shutting out some of the best suppliers. Second, a subsidy-based approach will be far more expensive than one that makes more use of carbon pricing, which encourages the reduction of emissions throughout the economy.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Open the door to ...</li>
<li>the reduction of emissions <mark>throughout</mark> the economy</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The downside of carbon taxes is that voters don‚Äôt like the sound of them, since they are, as the name implies, taxes. Governments have typically succeeded in putting a price on carbon only by stealth: using emissions-trading schemes that few voters understand.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Downside: A negative aspect or disadvantage of something.</li>
<li><mark>By stealth</mark>: This phrase indicates that governments have implemented carbon pricing discreetly, often without public awareness or understanding.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>To curb carbon fast enough without generating too much resistance, climate policies should be designed to inflict as little hassle and cost on households as is practical.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Inflict: to cause (something unpleasant) to be endured</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>To curb costs, governments should create predictable incentives to reduce emissions efficiently, meaning far more use of carbon pricing. Workers in industries that will eventually be shut down, such as coal, should be offered help, including training for new jobs. Judicious regulation can also play a role. If car firms are given a deadline to stop selling new petrol cars, they will strain to bring down the price and extend the range of electric vehicles. If deadlines are realistic, cleaner tech may already be cheaper than the dirty sort before it is compulsory.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Judicious regulation: This expression indicates that well-considered and carefully crafted regulations can play a beneficial role in achieving policy goals.
<ul>
<li>Judicious: showing good judgment, careful consideration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Plenty of clean technologies are cheaper in the long run but have stiff upfront costs.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Stiff: Difficult or substantial, often referring to challenges.</li>
</ul>
